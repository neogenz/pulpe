Context files for AI assistants working on Pulpe.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `projectbrief.md` | Project overview, philosophy, V1 scope, success metrics |
| `roadmap.md` | Product roadmap organized by release milestones (R1/R2/R3) |
| `productContext.md` | Business rules, workflows, domain glossary |
| `systemPatterns.md` | Architecture patterns, coding conventions, layer structure |
| `techContext.md` | Tech stack, Decision Records (MADR format) |
| `DA.md` | Brand guidelines, design system, UX writing |
| `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` | Development, CI/CD, deployment, monitoring |

## Usage

These files provide context for Claude Code and other AI tools. They are referenced in `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root.

## Maintenance

- Update `systemPatterns.md` when architecture changes
- Add Decision Records to `techContext.md` for significant technical choices
- Keep `productContext.md` in sync with business rule changes
