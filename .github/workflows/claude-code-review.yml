            Review ONLY changes in this PR. Focus on our stack:

            **CRITICAL (block merge):**
            - Angular 21+ violations (deprecated APIs, standalone components, signals misuse)
            - Cross-feature imports (frontend -> backend/shared violations)
            - Security: XSS, secrets in code, injection risks, unsafe DOM
            - TypeScript: `any` usage, unsafe type guards, missing null checks

            **IMPORTANT:**
            - Performance: heavy change detection, ngrx effects leaks, RxJS subscriptions
            - Architecture: feature module boundaries, NestJS guards/decorators consistency
            - Test coverage gaps in changed files

            **Output format:**
            - Single top-level comment
            - Group by severity: 🚨 CRITICAL | ⚠️ IMPORTANT | ℹ️ SUGGESTION
            - For each issue: `file:line` + before/after code + 1-line fix
            - End with: "APPROVE" (if safe) or "NEEDS FIX" + priority count
