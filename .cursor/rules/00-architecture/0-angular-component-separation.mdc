UI Component Constraints:
- Receive data through input properties only
- Notify changes through output events only
- Never inject services directly
- Define local interfaces for specific needs
- Keep components self-contained

Core Service Rules:
- Implement business logic and state management
- Provide data to features and layouts
- Never contain template-related code
- Use dependency injection patterns
- Organize by business domains

Feature Isolation:
- Features cannot import from each other
- Always use lazy loading for features
- Implement as complete black boxes
- Easy to extract as separate libraries
- Share logic by moving to core

Pattern Implementation:
- Package standalones with injectables
- Implement cross-cutting business features
- Provide drop-in component interface
- Reuse across multiple features
- Handle document management, audit logs, etc.
