# Rule Updates:

- **Add New Rules When:**
  - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
  - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
  - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
  - New security or performance patterns emerge

- **Modify Existing Rules When:**
  - Better examples exist in the codebase
  - Additional edge cases are discovered
  - Related rules have been updated
  - Implementation details have changed

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**

  ```typescript
  // If you see repeated patterns like:
  const data = await prisma.user.findMany({
    select: { id: true, email: true },
    where: { status: "ACTIVE" },
  });

  // Consider adding to [prisma.mdc](mdc:shipixen.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc):
  // - Standard select fields
  // - Common where conditions
  ```
