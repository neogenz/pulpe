description: Apply Angular enterprise architecture patterns with enforced boundaries for scalable frontend development, covering core/ui/layout/feature/pattern organization, standalone components, and dependency constraints
globs: frontend/projects/webapp/**/*.ts
alwaysApply: false

Architecture Folders:
- Use `core/` for injectables and providers
- Use `ui/` for reusable components
- Use `layout/` for header/footer components
- Use `feature/` for domain-specific modules
- Use `pattern/` for complex reusable patterns

Boundary Rules:
- Features import only `core/`, `ui/`, `pattern/`
- Layouts import only `core/`, `ui/`, `pattern/`
- UI imports only `core/`
- Core imports no app folders
