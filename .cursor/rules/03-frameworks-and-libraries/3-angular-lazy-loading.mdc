Feature Lazy Loading:
- Always use `loadChildren()` for features
- Never eager load feature modules
- Implement consistent routing API
- Support nested lazy sub-features
- Extract shared logic appropriately

Route Configuration:
- Use `loadChildren()` in route config
- Support multiple lazy loading levels
- Parent components must have router-outlet
- Implement consistent navigation patterns
- Handle sub-feature routing properly

Bundle Optimization:
- Single lazy: bundle with feature
- Multiple lazy: create virtual pre-bundle
- Eager and lazy: bundle in main.js
- Consider moving single-use to feature
- Extract when reused across features
