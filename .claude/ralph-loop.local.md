Create android application for Pulpe. You can read @ios/ folder to understand features, screens, etc. Follow best practices Android Kotlin 2026. Impl as Material Design 3 (https://m3.material.io/) adjust with my colors palette. Follow @memory-bank/DESIGN.md. Iterate until a complete app, with all features working and building. Please be careful with apiEndpoint base url and data structure returned from backend. You can read backend code and frontend webapp code if needed too.
