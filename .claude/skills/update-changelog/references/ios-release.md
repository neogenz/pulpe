# iOS Release

## Pre-launch freeze

Until the official App Store launch, `MARKETING_VERSION` stays at **1.0.0**. Only the build number (`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`) is incremented.

## When to bump iOS

iOS is bumped **only when `ios/**` files are modified** in the release. If only web or backend changed, iOS stays untouched.

## Apply version

Use the `build` command to increment the build number only:

```bash
cd ios && ./scripts/bump-version.sh build
cd ios && xcodegen generate
```

This increments `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` (e.g. 1 -> 2) without touching `MARKETING_VERSION`.

Do NOT use `set`, `major`, `minor`, or `patch` — these would change `MARKETING_VERSION`, which must stay at 1.0.0 until store launch.

## Files modified

After running the script, these files change:
- `ios/project.yml` — `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`
- `ios/Pulpe.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — regenerated by xcodegen

Both must be staged in the release commit.

## No separate tag

No iOS-specific git tag is created. The only tag is the unified product tag `vX.Y.Z`.
