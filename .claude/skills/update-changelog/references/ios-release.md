# iOS Release

## When to bump iOS

iOS is bumped **only when `ios/**` files are modified** in the release. If only web or backend changed, iOS stays untouched.

## Alignment rule

When iOS is affected, `MARKETING_VERSION` aligns to the **current product version** (from root `package.json`). iOS may skip versions — this is expected.

Example: Product goes v1.7.0 → v1.8.0 → v1.9.0 → v1.10.0, but iOS only changes in v1.7.0 and v1.10.0. iOS jumps from 1.7.0 to 1.10.0.

## Apply version

Use the `set` command to align iOS to the product version:

```bash
cd ios && ./scripts/bump-version.sh set X.Y.Z
cd ios && xcodegen generate
```

Where `X.Y.Z` is the new product version determined in Step 4.

Do NOT use `major`, `minor`, or `patch` — always use `set` to guarantee alignment with the product version.

## Files modified

After running the script, these files change:
- `ios/project.yml` — `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`
- `ios/Pulpe.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — regenerated by xcodegen

Both must be staged in the release commit.

## No separate tag

No iOS-specific git tag is created. The only tag is the unified product tag `vX.Y.Z`.
